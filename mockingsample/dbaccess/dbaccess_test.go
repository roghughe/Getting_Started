package dbaccess

/*
Okay, just put the DB method integration test functions in here, following the usual format of

 1) Set up the DB - populating tables etc
 2) Do your tests - eg read from the DB and check that what you've got matches
 3) Tear down the tests, removing stuff you may have put into the database

That code is beyond the scope of this example.
